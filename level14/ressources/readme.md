# Level14

## Objective
Create a program that extracts the raw flag strings, extracts the `ft_des` function, and applies it to generate the 15th flag.

## Steps

### Step 1: Extract Raw Flags and ft_des Function
Create a C program that extracts the raw flags and the `ft_des` function from the `getflag` binary. The program should include the necessary headers and structures to use the `ft_des` function.

### Step 2: Implement Transformation
Implement a main function that applies the `ft_des` transformation to the raw flags and prints the results.

### Step 3: Compile and Run
Compile the program and run it to obtain the 15th flag.

### Step 4: Verify
Check if the obtained flag matches the expected flag for this level.

### Step 5: Switch to `level15`
Switch to the `level15` user:

```bash
su level15
```

### Step 6: Verify
Execute `getflag` to verify that you have access:

```bash
getflag
```

This should give you the flag for this level.

Congratulations! You've successfully generated the 15th flag for `level14` and switched to the `level15` user.
